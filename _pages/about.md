I am a Ph.D. student in Computing Science at Simon Fraser University, working with [Prof. Richard Zhang](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~haoz/). Before that, I received my Master’s degree from the [Indian Institute of Technology](https://iitgn.ac.in/), Gandhinagar, India, where I studied [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.iitgn.ac.in/) with a research focus on Computer Vision and Deep Learning, particularly on visual perception problems such as object segmentation and localization under the supervision of [Prof. Shanmuganathan Raman](https://shanmuga.people.iitgn.ac.in/). Prior to that I did my Undergrad in Electronics Engineerig from Birla Vishwakarma Mahavidylaya which is one of the oldest universities of my state back in India.

<!-- I am a Ph.D. student in Computing Science at Simon Fraser University, working with [Prof. Ali Mahdavi-Amiri](https://arash-mham.github.io/) and [Prof. Richard Zhang](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~haoz/) on Computer Graphics research, focusing on Single View 3D Reconstruction, Primitive Fitting, and Generative Modeling.

I completed my M.Sc. at SFU studying sweep surfaces based shape abstraction, and previously earned dual degrees in Mechatronic Engineering (R&D) and Mathematical Sciences from the Australian National University. In my free time, I enjoy jigsaw puzzles, badminton, swimming, and hiking.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
