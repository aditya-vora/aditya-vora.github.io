I am a Ph.D. student in Computing Science at Simon Fraser University, working with [Prof. Hao Zhang](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~haoz/). 


Before that, I received my Master’s degree from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar, India](https://iitgn.ac.in/), where I studied [Electrical Engineering](https://ee.iitgn.ac.in/) with a research focus on Computer Vision and Deep Learning, particularly on visual perception problems such as object segmentation and localization under the supervision of [Prof. Shanmuganathan Raman](https://shanmuga.people.iitgn.ac.in/). 


Prior to that I did my Undergrad in Electronics Engineerig from Birla Vishwakarma Mahavidylaya. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies, soccer (love Arsenal F.C.), do cooking.
